   Created by master piano designer, Lothar Thomma, this classic grand piano with spade legs and full music desk, brings the very latest in music design and technology to a piano that fits easily in residential interiors. Re-engineered with quality components, the range of upgrades includes plate modification to accommodate new scales, new calculated string lengths, slow-fall fallboard and much more.
